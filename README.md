# Livestream 1/3/2021 Code Repository

This contains the code for the Discord Bot that we created on 1/3/2021 live on my YouTube channel.

# What did we do?

- We created an invite link filter so that it only allows invite links from specific Guilds to be sent on the server.

- We also created a discord bot that allows you to use emojis from another discord server, a feature that is similar to other Discord Bots that have done this before.

# Installation

- Clone the repository
- Run `npm i` or `yarn install`
- Run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` to run in dev mode, or replace `dev` with `start` to run in normal mode. Make sure you also run the `build` script before running in normal mode.
